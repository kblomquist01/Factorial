# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- use better variable types for the function, i havent worked with it enough to know how big of an integer code to use
- I could make it repeateable so that you dont have to repeat opening it if you want multiple factorials
- I want to add more to it so that it isnt just a factorial calculator, maybe a bigger class that this program will tie into
